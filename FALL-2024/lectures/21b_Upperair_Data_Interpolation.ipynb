    "# Grid Interpolation from Point Data\n",
    "There are times when we have point data but want to make a gridded analysis to be able to have the computer draw contours. While there are many gridded datasets available, sometimes it is best to only use the data you have to create your analysis, especially if you have extra data that were not used in the construction of other gridded products, or you are looking to do a mesoscale analysis over a smaller region. In this notebook we'll use some upperair geopotential height observations over the CONUS available from Iowa State data archives to demonstrate the capabilities in MetPy for gridding up point observations."

See the link to the documentation below for all of the detailed information.\n",

Some of them are historic to meteorology (e.g., `'cressman'`, `'barnes'`) and others are common interpolation methods from mathematics/statistics (e.g., `'linear'`, '`cubic'`, `'rbf'`). Depending on which type of interpolation method you use, there might be additional parameters that can be set to refine the output from the interpolation.\n",

This parameter should be set according to the units of your x and y values. If using lat/lon directly, then the units are degrees. If you are in some cartesian or projected space, the units are likely to be in meters or kilometers."
