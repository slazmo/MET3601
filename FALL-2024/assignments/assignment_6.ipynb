(5 points) Tansform the 30-year mean accumulated precipitation into a cumulative sum of precipitation (e.g., adding all of the previous days of the year precipitation to the current day so that at the last day of the year reflects the total accumulated precipitation for that time period).\n",

    "6. (10 points) Plot the 30-year mean accumulated precipitation along with the data for 2022 on a second axes. Again set your x-axis values to be Julian day of the year (e.g., 1-366, may need to be less for current year data).\n",
